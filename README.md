# AHP-ANP-Decision-making-Software
This project started after being challenged by my professor to translate our decision-making class into code

This piece of software implements Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods, specifically the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Analytic Network Process (ANP) to provide sophisticated platforms for evaluating various options against a set of criteria. This kind of tool is valuable in helping decision-makers assess complex scenarios where multiple, often conflicting, criteria need to be considered.
